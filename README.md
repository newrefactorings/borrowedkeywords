# Keywords File

This repository contains the **Keywords File**, which lists keywords borrowed from previous studies. These keywords were used to filter commits likely to contain refactorings during the analysis.

## Purpose

The keywords serve as a filtering mechanism to identify commits that are more likely to include software refactorings, helping streamline the process of commit analysis.

## How to Use

1. Open the `keywords.txt` file (or the relevant file in this repository).
2. Use the listed keywords as filters when analyzing commit messages or logs to identify potential refactorings.

## Acknowledgments

The keywords were selected based on insights from prior research studies.
